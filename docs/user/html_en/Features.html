<span id="index-0"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#features">Planning management</a><a class="headerlink" href="#planning-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>ProjeQtOr  provides all the elements needed to build a planning from workload, constraints between tasks and resources availability.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-1">Project</p>
<p>The project is the main element of ProjeQtOr.</p>
<p>It is also the highest level of visibility and definition of access rights based on profiles.</p>
<p>You can define profiles , some have visibility on all projects, others only on the projects they are assigned to.</p>
<p>You can also define sub-projects of a project and sub-project of sub-projects without limit to this hierarchical organization.</p>
<p>This allows for example to define projects that are not real projects , but just a definition of the structure for your organization.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-2">Activity</p>
<p>An activity is a task that must be planned, or includes other activities.</p>
<p>This is usually a task that has a certain duration and should be assigned to one or more resources.</p>
<p>Activities appear on the Gantt Planning view.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-3">Milestone</p>
<p>A milestone is an event or a key date of the project.</p>
<p>Milestones are commonly used to track delivery dates or force a start date of activity.</p>
<p>They can also be used to highlight the transition from one phase to the next one.</p>
<p>Unlike activities , milestones have no duration and no work.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-4">Resources</p>
<p>Resources can be assigned to activities.</p>
<p>This means that some work is defined on this activity for the resource.</p>
<p>Only the resources affected to the project of the activity can be assigned to the activity.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-5">Real work allocation</p>
<p>Resources enter their time spent on the Real work allocation screen.</p>
<p>This allows for a real-time monitoring of work.</p>
<p>Moreover, updating the left work allows to recalculate the planning taking into account the actual progress on each task.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-6">Planning</p>
<p>The planning is based on all the constraints defined:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>left work on each activity</li>
<li>availability of resources</li>
<li>rate of resource affectation to projects and assignment rate of resources to activities</li>
<li>planning mode for each activity (as soon as possible, fixed duration, ... )</li>
<li>dependencies between activities</li>
<li>priorities of activities and projects</li>
</ul>
<p>The planning is displayed as a Gantt chart.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-7">Project Portfolio</p>
<p>The planning can also be viewed as a Project Portfolio, which is a Gantt planning view restricted to one line per project, plus optionally selected milestones.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resource-management">
<span id="index-8"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#features">Resource management</a><a class="headerlink" href="#resource-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>ProjeQtOr  manages the availability of resources that can be affected to multiple projects. Tool calculates a reliable, optimized and realistic planning.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-9">Resources</p>
<p>Resources are the persons working on the project activities.</p>
<p>A resource can also be a group of persons (team) for which you do not want to manage individual detail.</p>
<p>You can manage this through the capacity of the resource, that can be greater than 1 (for a group of people) or less than 1 (for a person working part-time).</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-10">Affectations</p>
<p>The first step is to affect each resource to the projects on which it has to work, specifying the affectation rate (% of maximum weekly time spent on this project).</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-11">Assignments</p>
<p>Then you can assign resources to project activities.</p>
<p>This means that some work is defined on this activity for the resource.</p>
<p>Only the resources affected to the project of the activity can be assigned to the activity.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-12">Calendars</p>
<p>To manage off days, you have a global calendar.</p>
<p>This calendar can be split into multiple calendars, to manage distinct availability types :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>you can create a calendar &#8220;80% &#8221; with every Wednesday as off day</li>
<li>you can manage distinct holidays when working with international teams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each resource is then assigned to a calendar.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-13">Real work allocation</p>
<p>Resources enter their time spent on the Real work allocation screen. This allows for a real-time monitoring of work.</p>
<p>Moreover, updating the left work allows to recalculate the planning taking into account the actual progress on each task.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tickets-management">
<span id="index-14"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#features">Tickets management</a><a class="headerlink" href="#tickets-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>ProjeQtOr includes a Bug Tracker to monitor incidents on your projects, with possibility to include work on planned tasks of your projects.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-15">Ticket</p>
<p>A Ticket is any intervention not needing to be planned (or that cannot be planned).</p>
<p>It is generally a short activity for which you want to follow advancement to describe (and possibly provide) a result.</p>
<p>For example, bugs or problems can be managed through Tickets:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can not schedule the bugs before they are identified and registered</li>
<li>You must be able to give a solution to a bug (workaround or fix).</li>
</ul>
<p class="rubric" id="index-16">Simple tickets</p>
<p>Simple tickets are just simplified representations of Tickets for users that will &#8220;create&#8221; tickets but not &#8220;treat&#8221; them.</p>
<p>Elements created as simple tickets are also visible as Tickets, and vice versa.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="costs-management">
<span id="index-17"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#features">Costs management</a><a class="headerlink" href="#costs-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>All elements related to delays can also be followed as costs (from resources work) and managing other expenses all costs of the project are monitored and can generate invoices.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-18">Projects</p>
<p>The Project is the main entity of ProjeQtOr.
In addition to tracking work on projects, ProjeQtOr can track the costs associated with this work.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-19">Activities</p>
<p>An Activity is a task that must be planned, or includes other activities.
Work assigned to resources on activities is converted into associated costs.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-20">Resource cost</p>
<p>To calculate the cost of expenses ProjeQtOr  defines the Resources cost.
This cost may vary depending on the role of the resource and may change over time.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-21">Project expenses</p>
<p>Projects expenses can also record expenses not related to resource costs (purchase , lease, sub-contracting).</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-22">Individual expenses</p>
<p>Individual expenses can record expenses generated by a given resource.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-23"></span><span class="target" id="index-24"></span><span class="target" id="index-25"></span><p class="rubric" id="index-26">Quote, Orders, Term, Bill</p>
<p>ProjeQtOr  can manage various financial elements found on a project: Quotation (proposals), Orders (received from customers), the invoicing Terms and Bills.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="quality-management">
<span id="index-27"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#features">Quality management</a><a class="headerlink" href="#quality-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The specificity of ProjeQtOr  is that it is Quality Oriented : it integrates the best practices that can help you meet the quality requirements on your projects.</p>
<p>This way, the approval stage of your Quality Systems are eased, whatever the reference (ISO, CMMI, ...).</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-28">Workflows</p>
<p>Workflows are defined to monitor changes of possible status.</p>
<p>This allows, among other things, to restrict certain profiles from changing some status.</p>
<p>You can, for instance, limit the change to a validation status to a given profile, to ensure that only an authorized user will perform this validation.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-29">Delays for tickets</p>
<p>You can define Delays for ticket. This will automatically calculate the due date of the Ticket when creating the Ticket.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-30">Indicators</p>
<p>Indicators can be calculated relative to respect of expected work, end date or cost values.</p>
<p>Some indicators are configured by default , and you can configure your own depending on your needs.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-31">Alerts</p>
<p>Non respect of indicators (or the approach of non-respect target) can generate Alerts.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-32">Checklists</p>
<p>It is possible to define custom Checklists that will allow, for instance, to ensure that a process is applied.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-33">Reports</p>
<p>Many Reports are available to track activity on projects, some displayed as graphs.</p>
<p class="rubric">All is traced</p>
<p>Finally, thanks to ProjeQtOr , everything is traced.</p>
<p>You can follow-up, in a centralized and collaborative way, the various elements you used to follow-up (or not) in many Excel sheets : list of Questions &amp; Answers, recording Decisions impacting the project, management of documents configuration, follow-up of meetings ...</p>
<p>In addition, all updates are tracked on each item to keep (and display) an history of the life of the item.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="risks-management">
<span id="index-34"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#features">Risks management</a><a class="headerlink" href="#risks-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>ProjeQtOr  includes a comprehensive risks and opportunities management, including the action plan necessary to mitigate or treat them and monitoring occurring problems.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-35">Risks</p>
<p>A Risk is a threat or event that could have a negative impact on the project, which can be neutralized, or at least minimize, by predefined actions.</p>
<p>The risk management plan is a key point of the project management. Its objective is to :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>identify hazards and measure their impact on the project and their probability of occurrence,</li>
<li>identify avoidance measures (contingency) and mitigation in case of occurrence (mitigation),</li>
<li>identify opportunities,</li>
<li>monitor the actions of risks contingency and mitigation,</li>
<li>identify risks that eventually do happen (so they become issues).</li>
</ul>
<p class="rubric" id="index-36">Opportunities</p>
<p>An Opportunity can be seen as a positive risk. This is not a threat but an opportunity to have a positive impact on the project.</p>
<p>They must be identified and followed-up not to be missed out.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-37">Issues</p>
<p>Issue is a risk that happens during the project.</p>
<p>If the risk management plan has been properly managed, the issue should be an identified and qualified risk.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-38">Actions</p>
<p>Actions shall be defined to avoid risks, not miss the opportunities and solve issues.</p>
<p>It is also appropriate to provide mitigation actions for identified risks that did not occur yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="perimeter-management">
<span id="index-39"></span><h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#features">Perimeter management</a><a class="headerlink" href="#perimeter-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>ProjeQtOr allows you to monitor and record all events on your projects and helps you in managing of deviations, to control the perimeter of projects.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-40">Meetings</p>
<p>Follow-up and organize Meetings, track associated action plans, decisions and easily find this information afterwards.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-41">Periodic meetings</p>
<p>You can also create Periodic meetings, which are regularly recurring meetings (steering committees, weekly progress meetings, ... )</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-42">Decisions</p>
<p>Decisions follow-up allows you to easily retrieve the information about the origin of a decision :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>who has taken a particular decision ?</li>
<li>when?</li>
<li>during which meeting ?</li>
<li>who was present at this meeting?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not revolutionary, this feature can save you many hours of research in case of dispute .</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-43">Questions</p>
<p>Tracking Questions / Answers can also simplify your life on such exchanges, which often end up as a game of Ping - Pong with a poor Excel sheet in the role of the ball (when it is not a simple email exchange... ).</p>
<p class="rubric" id="index-44">Product and Version</p>
<p>ProjeQtOr includes Product management and Product Versions.</p>
<p>Each version can be connected to one or more projects.</p>
<p>This allows you to link your activities to target version.</p>
<p>This also allows to know, in the case of Bug Tracking, the version on which a problem is identified and the version on which it is (or will be) fixed.</p>
